            <h1><em>The Sights Of New York</em></h1>
            <h2>New York is one of the biggest cities in the world, so it's naturally going to have some beautiful sights.</h2>
            <h2>Hopefully, after this page, you'll not only get a sense of what New York feels like but where you might want to go.</h2>
            <h3>This first collection of photo belongs to, you guessed it, Time Sq. Known for its neon lights and buildings, the spot 
                never fails to attract attention year round.
            </h3>

        <!-- I actually ran into a lot of difficulty at this point. I wanted to add a multiple photo galleries, but they just kept getting 
        in the way of each other. What I ended up doing was just making all the images the same size. -->

        <h3>While a neon New York is great, it's still important to spend as much time as possible in nature, especially in an industrial city like New York.
            Central park is a great place to relax, but there are some hidden gems out such as sakura park and prospect park.
